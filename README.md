## Heroes of Pymoli

### Data Trends

After analyzing data for an independent gaming company on their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli, we discovered the following trends on purchases:

### Players perform in average 1.35 purchases, player with max number of purchases is 5. 
Increasing purchases per player to 2 can bring a +47% increase in revenue (+$1134.6).
To achieve this we recommend to increase the number of unique items that: (1) can be worn out (drive repurchases) or (2) have a complementary item. 

### 84% of players with a purchase are male, but women spend +9.8% more than males ($4.47 vs $4.07 per purchase).
A targeted campaign to bring more women players can be funded with the extra revenue coming from this ($47 per every 100 women users).

### 77% of players are between 15 and 29 years old (45% in the 20-24 range).

### Top selling items and most profitable items are almost the same and have an average price above $4.
