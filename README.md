## Heroes of Pymoli

After analyzing data for an independent gaming company on their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli, we discovered the following trends on purchases:

### Players perform in average 1.35 purchases, player with max number of purchases is 5. 
Increasing purchases per player to 2 can bring a +47% increase in revenue (+$1134.6).
To achieve this we recommend to increase the number of unique items that: (1) can be worn out (drive repurchases) or (2) have a complementary item. 

### Majority of players are male, but women spend almost 10% more than males.
84% of players with a purchase are male, but women spend +9.8% more than males ($4.47 vs $4.07 per purchase).
A targeted campaign to bring more women players can be funded with the extra revenue coming from this ($47 per every 100 women users).

### 77% of players are between 15 and 29 years old (45% in the 20-24 range).
Players in the range of 20-24 years spend in avg $4.32. Age groups with bigger spents are little in size: kids <10 years spend $4.54 and adults between 35 and 39 spend $4.76. Creating targeted campaigns to attract new players in those age groups could be funded wth the additional spend per player expected from them.

### Top selling items and most profitable items are almost the same and have an average price above $4. 
Most profitable items are the ones with more purchases and higher prices (which is natural since avg price and max price are fairly close).
Items are digital so no production costs are involved, meaning an increase in price will fully convert on revenue.
Users do not seem to favour cheap items over expensive items (top 5 items are above avg price) which probably implies that elasticity is low. We recommend to increase price on items below avg selling price (this will bring extra revenue and will not affect purchases).
